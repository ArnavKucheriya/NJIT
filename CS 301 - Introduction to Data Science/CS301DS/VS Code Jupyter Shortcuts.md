## Essential Keyboard Shortcuts
- Shift + Enter (⇧ + ↩): Execute the current cell and move to the next one. This is one of the fundamental shortcuts for running code in your notebook.

- Ctrl + Enter (⌃ + ↩): Execute the current cell and stay in the same cell. Useful for quickly rerunning code snippets.

- Alt + Enter (⌥ + ↩): Execute the current cell and insert a new cell below. This is a fantastic shortcut for rapid prototyping and experimentation.

- Esc (⎋): Exit edit mode in a cell. Pressing Esc allows you to navigate the notebook using keyboard shortcuts.

- Enter (↩): Enter edit mode in a cell. After pressing Enter, you can modify the content of the cell.

- Y: Change the cell type to code. When you’re in command mode (after pressing Esc), pressing ‘Y’ converts the selected cell to a code cell.

- M: Change the cell type to Markdown. Similarly, pressing ‘M’ in command mode converts the selected cell to a Markdown cell.

- A: Insert a new cell above the current cell. This is an efficient way to add cells without interrupting your flow.

- B: Insert a new cell below the current cell. Combined with ‘A’, this lets you effortlessly add cells wherever you need them.

- X: Cut the selected cell(s). You can then use ‘V’ to paste them elsewhere.

- C: Copy the selected cell(s). This is great for duplicating cells or moving them around.

- V: Paste cells below the selected cell. A simple way to reproduce or rearrange your work.

- Z: Undo cell deletion. Accidentally deleted a cell? Press ‘Z’ in command mode to bring it back.

- D, D (press ‘D’ twice): Delete the selected cell(s). A quick way to clean up your notebook.

## Advanced Shortcuts
- Shift + M: Merge selected cells. If you have multiple cells selected, this combines them into a single cell.

- Shift + Up/Down Arrow: Extend the selected cell(s) by one row up or down. This is useful when you want to select multiple cells quickly.

- Ctrl + Shift + “-” (⌃ + ⇧ + “-”): Split the current cell into two cells at the cursor position. Perfect for dividing large cells.

- Shift + Tab (⇧ + ⇥): Indent or unindent the line where the cursor is located. Useful for organizing code neatly.
