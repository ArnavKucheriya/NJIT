    "Hierarchical clustering groups instances into a hierarchy of clusters where one end is a single cluster that contains all instances and at the other end are clusters that contain just one instance. Two types of hierarchical clustering methods exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agglomerative hierarchical clustering** is a clustering method where each instance is treated as an individual cluster, and two clusters are combined iteratively until all instances belong to a single cluster. Since agglomerative clustering is less computationally complex, this section will primarily focus on this technique.\n",
    "- **Divisive hierarchical clustering** is a clustering method where all instances belong to a single cluster, and each cluster is split into two clusters iteratively until all clusters just contain a single instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agglomerative hierarchical clustering and divisive hierarchical clustering perform similarly. But, the clusters obtained using each algorithm are likely to differ."
