An International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a code of 
%10 characters, referred to in this case as the class $ ISBN-10 , 
separated by dashes such as private number $0-7637-0798-8 
$End the formatting 
begin
If the ISBN number starts with ISBN-10 it consists of four parts: 
group code, a publisher code, a code that uniquely identifies the book among those published by 
a particular publisher, and a check character. 
The check character is used to validate an ISBN. For the ISBN 0-7637-0798-8, the group code is 0, 
which identifies the book as one from an English-speaking country. 
While the %publisher code @_ 7637 is for @Jones and @Bartlett Publishers
